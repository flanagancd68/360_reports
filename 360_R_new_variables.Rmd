# **09d** | Physician query listing -------------------------------------------
1. Purpose: detect query pattern variance among coders
1. new tables: 09d_all
1. Questions
    - do some coders never generate queries? 
        - Rate: Query_Rate = (Queries / Accounts coded) %>% identify lowest performers at facility and hub level
        - Plot: 
    - Is there a correlation between severity capture and querying
        - Plot: Query_Rate vs average severity score (excluding OB and NB)
    - In the aggregate, do coders who query more have lower productivity than coders who do not?
        - Plot: queries vs accounts coded
    - Is there a correlation between higher precision and accuracy and higher querying?
        - Plot: Precision vs query rate
    - Do some facilities appear to have a culture of not querying?
        - Query rate by hospital then identify lowest facility performers
    - Are there any facilities that have a wide variation between coders who query and coders who do not?
        - rate sd(query_rate)


# **CAC001** | auto|suggested codes precision and recall -------------------
1. Purpose: detect variance and assess general effectiveness of the NLP engine. Low rates can be indicative of coder adoption or NLP tuning opportunities.
1. Four new tables:
	    1. CAC001_ip_dx_all
	    2. CAC001_ip_px_all
CAC001_all_fac:
- All_Suggested_fac = sum of all auto-suggested codes at a facility
- Accepted_fac = sum of all accepted coded at a facility
- All_coded_fac = sum of total codes at a facility
- % Precision_fac = Accepted_fac / All suggested_fac
- % Recall_fac = Accepted_fac / All_coded_fac
    - Precision and Recall rates are also provided at the hub level
- 


# **CAC003** | auto-suggested codes precision and recall by code ---------------------
1. Purpose: Identify low percentage acceptance of certain codes.  Can be used to evaluate coder adoption or NLP engine performance opportunities
1. Four new tables:
    1. CAC003_ip_cdr_all
    2. CAC003_ip_fac_all


# **CAC007** All Codes Entry Method Summary ------------------------
1. Purpose: determine coder and facility CAC vs manual entry methods
    - This is a really exciting report!  We can get at coder adoption of CAC
1. eight new tables:
    1. CAC007_ip_dx_cdr_all
    2. CAC007_ip_dx_fac_all

	
# **CAC008** | Auto-suggested codes listing ------------------------------------
1. Purpose: This report can be used for researching why coders may be rejecting A/S codes
1. One new tables: CAC008_all

    
# **IP004** | Primary and Secondary DRG Listing ----------------------------------------------------------
1. Purpose: Coded account inforation including DRGs

2. new tables:
    1. CAC008_all

# **Prod016** | Coder Productivity -----------------------
