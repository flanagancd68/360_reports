## CAC008 Auto-suggested codes listing ==============
# If anything is slow, it's this section.  If you decide you don't want it,
# just select the code down to where IP004 starts and hit ctrl+shift+c - this
# will `comment` it and stop it from running.
# also if youâ€™re looking for raw speed, try data.table::fread()
# as above ignore warnings about number of columns not multiple of vector
# we'll fix that later
