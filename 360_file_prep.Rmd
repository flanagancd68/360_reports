# This document is important!
- Failure to adhere to these specifications will result in one of the following:
    - You will get an error when trying to run the main script
        - The error may not necessarily be upon file import but could be down in the middle of some other analysis 
    - You will **NOT** get an error (which is actually worse!)
        - The routine will run as if your files are formatted appropriatley resulting in reports that _look_ normal but are actually flawed
        - This means your conclusions may also be flawed

# Initial set-up

## Download and install R and Rstudio
1. Download and install Base R package:
    a. https://www.r-project.org/
    b. Select the CRAN Mirror that is closest to you
    b. Download the applicable Windows, Mac, or Linux package
4. Download and install R studio console
    a. must have Base R installed first
    b. https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
    c. Unless you know you want/need/can afford a different version, pick `Open Source RStudio Desktop` (Free)
5. Launch RStudio
    a. At a console, type
        a. `install.packages("tidyverse", "plotly")`
    b. This will download the required packages used by our scripts
    c. if you don't do this now, you will get an error when you try to run the scripts later
    

## The 'Master' version of the source code will be maintained at GitHub.com
1. In Rstudio:
    a. File | New Project | Version Control | Git
    b. repository url: https://github.com/flanagancd68/360_reports.git
    c. project directory `360_reports` (should default to this)
    c. create project as a subdirectory of:
        a. This is up to you but make it somewhere you can find it later!
    c. For basic, "read-only" use, you do not need a github account.   Feel free to contact me if you wish to become a contributer to the project.

2. The following directories should have been created after you synched up with github
    a. under `360_reports`, a `data` directory 
    b. under the `data` directory there should be **three* subfolders:
        1. `cons` where consolidated reports (e.g. a single file for each report that combines data from multiple 360 hubs) will be saved
        2. `external`, where various publically available data will be downloaded (e.g. DRG tables and the like)
        3. `internal`, which is where you will save your 360 reports in Excel format.  The remainder of this document discusses the reports we will be using for our data analysis
        
## Facility specific information
- Navigate to the `360_reports/data/external` folder and open `fac_list_template.xlsx`
- Please update the xlsx file with your facility specific data
        b. We're trying to be as accomodating as we can from single-facility to multiple-facility/single-hub, to multiple-facility/multiple-hub environments
        c. **even if you only have a single facility, please update the xlsx with your facility nformation** - this will allow everyone to use the same R code.
- important! save as `fac_codes.xlsx` in the **`internal`** subdirectory
       
    
    
# General information for 360 reports

## Compiling 360 reports
If you are unfamiliar with how to compile and save 360 reports in Excel format please review the materials from this link (login required):
- https://apps.3mhis.com/download/3M_Docs_Secured/360_Encompass/360_P2_library/index.htm#reports_360v2.htm
- The instructions below will assume you know how to do this!

- Select the designated report and adjust the report parameters as indicated in each report specific section below
- Several reports will have multiple versions needed
    - one for inpatient (ip) and one for outpatient (op)
    - one for diagnoses (dx) and one for procedures (dx)
    - one for coder (cdr) and one for facility (fac)
    - as applicable, we append the abbreviations as suffixes to the report name for easier identification
- *Why do we need different versions of the same report?*
    - As of the date of this writing, the OP and IP NLP engines are distinct.  When it comes to NLP engine tuning opportunities, we want to be specific as to which engine.
    - From a coder standpoint, ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, and CPT/HCPCS are three completely different coding schemes.  When it comes to coder education opportunities, we similarly want to be specific as to which type of coding.

## Saving report parameters in 360

1. After you run each report for the first time you will want to save your criteria to make things much easier in the future
    - *After* you have updated each report with the criteria specified below, click the **"Save As..."** to save the report criteria
    - this will save CDI09d report criteria under "CDI Reports / Saved", and the remaining reports under "HIM Coding Reports / Saved"
    - The preferred name is provided below and is based on the required Excel file name
        - you can change the `cf` to whosever initials will be compiling the reports.  This will group them together in 360.
    - Another benefit to saved reports is that if you used `quarter -1` as your date range, when you run the saved report the next quarter, the dates should automatically adjust

## Exporting reports to Excel Format
TIP: before hitting the **Export To** button, select and copy the saved name of the report from the list of "Saved" 360 reports.  (You'll see why in a minute...)
1. Next after the report has compiled you will need to **Export To** | `Excel (.xlsx format)` for some basic file prep
    - Depending on your browser, a new tab might open or the file might automitically download
    - if given the option to `Open`, `Save`, or `Save as`:
        - select "Save As"
        - save the file in the `360_reports/data/internal` directory
        - if you copied the name of the report, now simply PASTE (or ctrl+v) in the File Name: box
        - now simply replace the initials (`cf` in the examples below) with the YYYY.Q corresponding to the report date
        - This will help to make sure your reports are named correctly 
    

1. generally we will be using 'HIM Coding Reports' but there is one CDI report
1. For additional assistance or information please visit 

# .xlsx file naming convention

- YYYY.Q = four digit year and calendar quarter (1-4) + # = hub number + number of 3M report + suffixes as needed to distinguish different groupings of the same report + .xlsx file extension
- examples: 
    - **2019.4_3_CAC007_ip_dx_cdr.xlsx**, means the CAC007 report for the 4th quarter 2019 that displays diagnoses for inpatients by coder on hub/server #3, saved as an Excel file
    - **2019.4_1_IP004.xlsx**, means the IP004 report for the 4th quarter 2019 for hub/server #1 (please add the "_1_" even if you do not have more than one server/hub)

# **CAC008** | Auto-suggested codes listing
1. Purpose: This report can be used for researching why coders may be rejecting A/S codes
1. One file needed: YYYY.Q_h_CAC008.xlsx
    - Notes: 
        - The nice thing about the output is that it contains the `Dx/Proc` and `Pt Type` fields
        - This makes it unnecessary to need to run separate versions; *however*, depending on volume of patients on your server, the resulting Excel file may be too big
        -   i.e. the report may compile but when you attempt to export to Excel, 3M will throw an error
        - The workaround is to compile for ONLY the final month of the quarter
        - we are just looking for representative accounts; we are not generating any kinds of stats from these
1. Parameters
    1. Date Type: Discharge Date | From Date: First of Quarter -1 | Through Date: End of Quarter -1  (unless you need to run one month at a time)     1. Visit Type: -All- | Patient Type:  -All-    
    1. ICD Version: Billable | Type: IDx,IPx,HCPCS | Codeset Type: HIM | Coder: -All- | Code: 
    1. Primary Payer: -All- | Financial Class: -All- | Facility: -All-  

# **IP003** | HAC DRG Summary
1. Purpose: determine whether certain coders have variance suggesting over/under-reporting HACS
2. File needed: YYYY.Q_h_IP003_mcr.xlsx
3. Parameters:
    - Date Type: Discharge Date | From Date: First of Quarter -1 | Through Date: End of Quarter -1
    - Group 2 = **Coder** | Group 3 = **Post HAC DRG**
    - Visit Type: -All- | Patient Type:  -All- | HIM Coder: -All- | Discharge Disposition: -All- 
    - Grouper Type: **Medicare** | Group 3 Sort: Group3  | DRG HAC Status: -All- | Code Set: Final | ICD Version: Billable
    - Primary Payer: -All- | Financial Class: **Medicare and Managed Medicare**  | Facility: -All-


    
# **IP004** | Primary and Secondary DRG Listing
1. Purpose: Coded account inforation including DRGs
    - **Important note**: the routine assumes that you will have a secondary DRG populated 100% of the time.  
    - The script will parse out APR vs CMS DRGs, and generate reports on each
    - However if you aren't collecting secondary DRGs, **the resulting data will be skewed**  
    - Two workarounds:
        - Filter on applicable financial (e.g. Medicare only for MS-DRG)
        - If your patient accounting system is capable, you can import a flat file of patient DRG data
            - this gets complex and unfortunately is beyond my ability to assist you.  Contact your local IT department  
            - I will set up the basic infrastructure but you will likely need to tweak (especially if your system account number format doesn't match 360's)  
2. Files Needed:
    1. YYYY.Q_h_IP004.xlsx
3. Parameters
    23. Date / include secondary / primary: coder / secondary: none
    25. We need to run this file one month at a time and then manually combine in excel - you may or may not need to

# **IPPlus001** | Case Mix Summary

*Note: choose ***IPPlus001*** and not the regular IP001*
    - The distinction is that IP001 will only calculate CMI based on the *primary* grouper, where as IPPlus001 will calculate on BOTH primary *and* secondary groupers
    - in other words, if you are collecting secondary grouper information on every patient, the sum total of your "total visits" column will be double your actual coded accounts
    - Since the purpose is to gauge relative CMI variation, the actual patient counts is not as important - this is the CMI across all patients whether 100 or 1000
    - With that said, when including all financial classes, we might consider an "adjustment factor" to offset the low CMI of coders who may code an unusually high amount of delivery and newborn accounts

    
1. Purpose: determine whether certain coders have variance on CMI across groupers and medical vs surgical
2. File needed: YYYY.Q_h_IPPlus001.xlsx
3. Parameters:
    - Date Type: Discharge Date | From Date: First of Quarter -1 | Through Date: End of Quarter -1
    - Group 2 = **Coder** | Group 3 = **Financial Class**
    - Visit Type: -All- | Patient Type: -All- | Coder: -All-
    - Grouper Type: -All- | ICD Version: Billable | Location: -All- | Discharge Disposition: -All-
    - Primary Payer: -All- | Financial Class: -All- | Facility: -All-
