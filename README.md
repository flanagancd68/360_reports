# 360_reports
R is powerful software for statistical analysis.  In this project, we will use R to do
'post-processing' on some 360 reports in much the same way a photographer would use
image retouching or manipulation software on photographs.  In other words, this won't
change any of the data, but effective use can make the data 'pop'.
