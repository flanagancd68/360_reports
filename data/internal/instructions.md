The `internal` subfolder is where your <sensitive> 360 report files are saved.  
  There should be 23 files for each 360 hub/server
The scripts will read the .xlsx files from THIS folder so please make sure to read the `360_file_prep.Rmd` and other setup documents
  
 Additionally, locate the `fac_list_template.xlsx` file, update it with your specific facility information, and then save the the updated file as `fac_list.xlsx` in the `internal` folder on your local computer.
