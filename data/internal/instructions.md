The `internal` subfolder is where your <sensitive> 360 report files are saved.  
  There should be 23 files for each 360 hub/server.
  
The R scripts will read the .xlsx files from THIS folder so please make sure to read `360_file_prep.Rmd` and the other setup documents
  
 Additionally, open the `fac_list_template.xlsx` file (located in the `external` folder), update it with your specific facility information, and then save the the updated file as `fac_list.xlsx` in the `internal` folder on your local computer.
